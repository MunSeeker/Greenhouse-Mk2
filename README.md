MunSeeker Greenhouse-Mk2 TAC
============================

============================
PLEASE NOTE: The Mk2 Greenhouse is now deprecated. It does not work in KSP .25 and up due to a change in KSP stock texture management.
============================


A greenhouse designed for TAC Life Support (version 0.9 and up), based on the stock KSP Structural Fuselage model.

Converts Electricity (a lot), Waste, Carbon Dioxide and Waste Water to Food. 

There is some loss in this process, so the crew will still need to be supplied. One greenhouse will use 50% of the waste products of 3 Kerbals (waste, waste water and carbon dioxide) and supply them with roughly 15% oxygen, 30% water and 35% food of their total needs.

Growing food in a cramped greenhouse in zero G is energy intensive. One small Mk2 Greenhouse uses about 0.6 Electrical Units per second, or about 2100 per hour (the RTG produces about 0.75/second, so one RTG could supply one small greenhouse).

My goal was to realistically extend the food supply for a crew of kerbonauts without completely removing the need of regular resupply missions. This is a good companion to the TAC Carbon Extractor and Water Purifier. 

This greenhouse is heavy (almost 3 tons) and needs oodles of energy, so its use needs careful consideration.

Note that while this looks similar to the Structural Fuselage, it is far heavier and has much lower crash tolerance.

The model references the stock structural fuselage with a new texture, the configuration is based on the TAC recyclers with some ideas from the Simple Greenhouse (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80410-DEV-HALTED-Simple-TAC-LS-Greenhouse-v0-1) by marce.
