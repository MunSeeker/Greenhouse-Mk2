MunSeeker Greenhouse Mk2 TAC

A small greenhouse designed for TAC life support, based on the stock Cupola model. Converts Electricity (a lot), Waste, Carbon Dioxide and Waste Water to Food. 

There is some loss in this process, so the crew will still need to be supplied. One greenhouse will use 50% of the waste products of 3 Kerbals (waste, waste water and carbon dioxide) and supply them with 15% oxygen, 30% water and 40% food of their total needs.

Growing food in a cramped greenhouse in zero G is energy intensive. One small Mk2 greenhouse uses about 0.2 Electrical Units per second, or about 800 per hour (the RTG produces about 0.75/second, so one RTG could supply three small greenhouses).

My goal was to realistically extend the food supply for a crew of kerbonauts without completely removing the need of regular resupply missions. This is a good companion to the TAC Carbon Extractor and Water Purifier. 

This greenhouse is heavy (almost 3 tons) and needs oodles of energy, so its use needs careful consideration.

Note that while this looks similar to the Structural Fuselage, it is far heavier and has much lower crash tolerance.

The model references the stock structural fuselage with a new texture, the configuration is based on the TAC recyclers with some ideas from the Simple Greenhouse (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80410-DEV-HALTED-Simple-TAC-LS-Greenhouse-v0-1) by marce.
